# Capstone-Project-Davi-Giua

This is the repository for the capstone project of Valentina Dav√¨ and Federica Giua. 
What we want to do is collect the tweets that contain both the hashtags "coronavirus" and "fakenews", considering that in the last days there has been a growing attention towards the phenomenon of coronavirus, and this has led to growing concerns among the population, sometimes becoming pure panic. 
This panic is also fueled by the fact that information about the virus is scarce, and not always well communicated. This also leaves space to the spreading of fake news. 
We want to
- collect a sample of the tweets written about these two hashtags. We are limiting the collection to tweets written in English, for homogeneity and interpretation reasons. 

- visualize the trend of these hasthags, to see whether the public attention has changed in the last days, or if it's concentrated in some particular moments. 

- try and visualize what are the words that are most used in these tweets, to try and develop some understanding of what the public thinks about the combination of these two phenomena.
