# Capstone Project Davi-Giua
# The spreading of fear through social media: #fakenews and #coronavirus

## Introduction
This is the repository for the capstone project of Valentina Dav√¨ and Federica Giua, the final assignment for the Data Access II Module exam. We are from the DAPS&Co program, University of Milan new master's degree and we are learning how to scrape data from the web, and to conduct sentiment analysis. This project is also a way to show what we have learned in class and also to improve our skills.

## What the research is about
What we want to do is collect the tweets that contain both the hashtags "coronavirus" and "fakenews", considering that in the last days there has been a growing attention towards the phenomenon of coronavirus, and this has led to growing concerns among the population, sometimes becoming pure panic. In fact, this panic is also fueled by the fact that information about the virus is scarce, and not always well communicated. This also leaves space to the spreading of fake news, incorrect informations and, later on, fear among people.

## Our goals
We want to:

- collect a sample of the tweets written about these two hashtags. We are limiting the collection to tweets written in Italian, for homogeneity and interpretation reasons. 

- visualize the trend of these hasthags, to see whether the public attention has changed in the last days, or if it's concentrated in some particular moments. 

- try and visualize what are the words that are most used in these tweets, to try and develop some understanding of what the public thinks about the combination of these two phenomena.

## Collecting data
First of all, we are trying to collect italian tweets containing #coronavirus and fakenews

## Packages used
rtweet

P.s. We will update this repo as soon as we figure out what we are able to do and how to do it.
